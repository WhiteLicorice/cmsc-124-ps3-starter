;;;; evaluator.lisp -- Part 2. Write the eight functions below.
;;;;
;;;; The toy language is a Lisp-1. One namespace holds both variables and
;;;; functions, so a variable bound to a closure is callable in operator
;;;; position and (f 1) works with no FUNCALL. The CLISP hosting this file is a
;;;; Lisp-2, which is why the host needs FUNCALL and #' where the toy language
;;;; needs neither. ANALYSIS.md asks you about that difference.
;;;;
;;;; An environment is an association list: ((name . value) (name . value) ...).
;;;; The grader scores E1 to E4 separately, so finish them in order and keep
;;;; every group you get right.
;;;;
;;;; The grammar, in full:
;;;;
;;;;   expr := number
;;;;         | symbol
;;;;         | (+ expr expr) | (- expr expr) | (* expr expr)
;;;;         | (let ((name expr) ...) body)
;;;;         | (lambda (name ...) body)
;;;;         | (operator-expr argument-expr ...)

;;; E1 -- numbers and symbols.

(defun lookup (name env)
  (let ((pair (assoc name env)))
    (if pair 
        (cdr pair)
        (error "no name for ~a" name))))

;;; E2 -- prefix arithmetic.

(defun eval-operands (exprs env)
  (mapcar (lambda (n) (eval-expr n env))  exprs))

(defun apply-op (op values)
  (cond ((eq op '+) (+ (first values) (second values)))
  ((eq op '-) (- (first values) (second values)))
  ((eq op '*) (* (first values) (second values)))
  (t (error "unknown operator ~a" op))))

  "Apply the arithmetic operator OP to the two numbers in VALUES.

OP is the symbol +, -, or *. Signal an error for anything else."


;;; E3 -- let.

(defun extend-env (params args env)
  "ENV with PARAMS bound to ARGS in front of it.

MAPCAR takes two lists and #'CONS pairs them. Build a new list. Do not modify
ENV, because the caller keeps using it after the extension goes out of scope."
  (append (mapcar #'cons params args) env))

(defun eval-let (expr env)
  "Evaluate (let ((name init) ...) body).

Every init is evaluated in ENV before any name is bound, so the bindings happen
in parallel and an init cannot see a name the same LET introduces."
  (let ((bindings (second expr))
        (body (third expr)))
    (let ((names (mapcar #'first bindings))
          (inits (mapcar #'second bindings)))
      (let ((vals (eval-operands inits env)))
        (eval-expr body (extend-env names vals env))))))

;;; E4 -- lambda and application.

(defun make-closure (params body env)
  "A closure over ENV.

Return the list (:closure params body env). ENV is the environment the lambda
was written in, not the one it will later be called from. Saving the wrong one
is what makes the difference between 3 and 101 in the case the manual walks
through."
  (declare (ignore params body env))
  (error "make-closure is not implemented"))

(defun apply-closure (closure args)

CLOSURE is not a closure, and when the argument count does not match."
