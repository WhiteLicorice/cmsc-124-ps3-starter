;;;; evaluator.lisp -- Part 2. Write the eight functions below.
;;;;
;;;; The toy language is a Lisp-1. One namespace holds both variables and
;;;; functions, so a variable bound to a closure is callable in operator
;;;; position and (f 1) works with no FUNCALL. The CLISP hosting this file is a
;;;; Lisp-2, which is why the host needs FUNCALL and #' where the toy language
;;;; needs neither. ANALYSIS.md asks you about that difference.
;;;;
;;;; An environment is an association list: ((name . value) (name . value) ...).
;;;; The grader scores E1 to E4 separately, so finish them in order and keep
;;;; every group you get right.
;;;;
;;;; The grammar, in full:
;;;;
;;;;   expr := number
;;;;         | symbol
;;;;         | (+ expr expr) | (- expr expr) | (* expr expr)
;;;;         | (let ((name expr) ...) body)
;;;;         | (lambda (name ...) body)
;;;;         | (operator-expr argument-expr ...)

;;; E1 -- numbers and symbols.

(defun lookup (name env)
  (let ((pair (assoc name env)))
    (if pair 
        (cdr pair)
        (error "no name for ~a" name))))

;;; E2 -- prefix arithmetic.

(defun eval-operands (exprs env)
  (mapcar (lambda (n) (eval-expr n env))  exprs))

(defun apply-op (op values)
  (cond ((eq op '+) (+ (first values) (second values)))

  ((eq op '*) (* (first values) (second values)))
  (t (error "unknown operator ~a" op))))

  "Apply the arithmetic operator OP to the two numbers in VALUES.

OP is the symbol +, -, or *. Signal an error for anything else."


;;; E3 -- let.

(defun extend-env (params args env)
  "ENV with PARAMS bound to ARGS in front of it.

MAPCAR takes two lists and #'CONS pairs them. Build a new list. Do not modify
ENV, because the caller keeps using it after the extension goes out of scope."
  (append (mapcar #'cons params args) env))

(defun eval-let (expr env)
  "Evaluate (let ((name init) ...) body).

          (inits (mapcar #'second bindings)))
      (let ((values (eval-operands inits env)))
        (eval-expr body (extend-env names values env))))))

;;; E4 -- lambda and application.

(defun make-closure (params body env)
  "A closure over ENV.

was written in, not the one it will later be called from. Saving the wrong one
is what makes the difference between 3 and 101 in the case the manual walks
through."

(defun apply-closure (closure args)
